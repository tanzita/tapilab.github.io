#### Abstract

Recent work has demonstrated the value of social media monitoring for health
surveillance (e.g., tracking influenza or depression rates). It is an open
question whether such data can be used to make causal inferences (e.g.,
determining which activities lead to increased depression rates). Even in
traditional, restricted domains, estimating causal effects from observational
data is highly susceptible to confounding bias. In this work, we estimate the
effect of exercise on mental health from Twitter, relying on statistical
matching methods to reduce confounding bias. We train a text classifier to
estimate the volume of a user's tweets expressing anxiety, depression, or
anger, then compare two groups: those who exercise regularly (identified by
their use of physical activity trackers like Nike+), and a matched control
group. We find that those who exercise regularly have significantly fewer
tweets expressing depression or anxiety; there is no significant difference in
rates of tweets expressing anger. We additionally perform a sensitivity
analysis to investigate how the many experimental design choices in such a
study impact the final conclusions, including the quality of the classifier
and the construction of the control group.
