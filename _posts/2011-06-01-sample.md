#### Abstract

We present SampleRank, an alternative to contrastive divergence (CD) for
estimating parameters in complex graphical models. SampleRank harnesses a
user-provided loss function to distribute stochastic gradients across an MCMC
chain. As a result, parameter updates can be computed between arbitrary MCMC
states. SampleRank is not only faster than CD, but also achieves better
accuracy in practice (up to 23% error reduction on noun-phrase coreference).
