#### Abstract

Social media provide a potentially useful new data source to understand
emerging public health behaviors. In this paper, we study messages about
e-cigarettes posted to Twitter.com. We apply methods to classify messages by
sentiment and to estimate the gender and age of users. We apply our approach
to nearly one million messages about e-cigarettes posted from October 2012 to
September 2013. We find that overall volume of e-cigarette tweets increased
five-fold (from 30K per month to 150K per month); and that males and younger
users were more likely to post positive messages about e-cigarettes. A
qualitative analysis also reveals several trends, such as negative sentiment
toward people who smoke in class; females giving e-cigarettes to relatives to
help them quit smoking; and spikes in people using e-cigarettes to quit
smoking in January.
