#### Abstract

Consumer perceptions are important components of brand equity and therefore
marketing strategy. Segmenting these perceptions into attributes such as
eco-friendliness, nutrition, and luxury enable a fine-grained understanding of
the brand's strengths and weakness. Traditional approaches towards monitoring
such perceptions (e.g., surveys) are costly and time-consuming, and their
results may quickly become outdated. Extant data mining methods are not
suitable for this goal, and generally require extensive hand-annotated data or
context customization, which leads to many of the same limitations as direct
elicitation. Here, we investigate a novel, general, and fully automated method
for inferring attribute-specific brand perception ratings by mining the
brand's social connections on Twitter.

Using a set of over 200 brands and three perceptual attributes, we compare the
method's automatic ratings estimates with directly-elicited survey data,
finding a consistently strong correlation. The approach provides a reliable,
flexible, and scalable method for monitoring brand perceptions, and offers a
foundation for future advances in understanding brand-consumer social media
relationships.
