#### Abstract

  Social Internet content plays an increasingly critical role in many domains,
  including public health, disaster management, and politics. However, its
  utility is limited by missing geographic information; for example, fewer
  than 1.6% of Twitter messages (*tweets*) contain a geotag. We propose
  a scalable, content-based approach to estimate the location of tweets using
  a novel yet simple variant of gaussian mixture models. Further, because
  real-world applications depend on quantified uncertainty for such estimates,
  we propose novel metrics of accuracy, precision, and calibration, and we
  evaluate our approach accordingly. Experiments on 13 million global,
  comprehensively multi-lingual tweets show that our approach yields reliable,
  well-calibrated results competitive with previous computationally intensive
  methods. We also show that a relatively small number of training data are
  required for good estimates (roughly 30,000 tweets), and models are quite
  time-invariant (effective on tweets many weeks newer than the training set).
  Finally, we show that toponyms and languages with small geographic footprint
  provide the most useful location signals.
