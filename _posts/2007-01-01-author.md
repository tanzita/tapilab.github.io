#### Abstract

Author disambiguation is the problem of determining whether records in a
publications database refer to the same person. A common supervised machine
learning approach is to build a classifier to predict whether a *pair* of
records is coreferent, followed by a clustering step to enforce
transitivity. However, this approach ignores powerful evidence obtainable by
examining *sets* (rather than *pairs*) of records, such as the number
of publications or co-authors an author has. In this paper we propose a
representation that enables these *first-order features* over sets of
records. We then propose a training algorithm well-suited to this
representation that is (1) *error-driven* in that training examples are
generated from incorrect predictions on the training data, and (2)
*rank-based* in that the classifier induces a *ranking* over candidate
predictions. We evaluate our algorithms on three author disambiguation
datasets and demonstrate error reductions of up to 60% over the standard
binary classification approach.
