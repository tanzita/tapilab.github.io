#### Abstract

Record deduplication is the task of merging database records that refer to the
same underlying entity. In relational databases, accurate deduplication for
records of one type is often dependent on the merge decisions made for records
of other types. Whereas nearly all previous approaches have merged records of
different types independently, this work models these inter-dependencies
explicitly to collectively deduplicate records of multiple types. We construct
a conditional random field model of deduplication that captures these
relational dependencies, and then employ a novel relational partitioning
algorithm to jointly deduplicate records. We evaluate the system on two
citation matching datasets, for which we deduplicate both papers and
venues. We show that by collectively deduplicating paper and venue records, we
obtain up to a 30% error reduction in venue deduplication, and up to a 20%
error reduction in paper deduplication over competing methods.
