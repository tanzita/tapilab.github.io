#### Abstract

Many clustering problems can be reduced to the task of partitioning a weighted
graph into highly-connected components. The weighted edges indicate pairwise
similarity between two nodes and can often be estimated from training
data. However, in many domains, there exist higher-order dependencies not
captured by pairwise metrics. For example, there may exist soft constraints on
aggregate features of an entire cluster, such as its size, mean or mode. We
propose **clusterwise** similarity metrics to directly measure the cohesion
of an entire cluster of points. We describe ways to learn a clusterwise metric
from labeled data, using weighted, first-order features over
clusters. Extending recent work equating graph partitioning with inference in
graphical models, we frame this approach within a discriminatively-trained
Markov network. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated on the task of
**coreference resolution**.
