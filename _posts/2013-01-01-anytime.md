#### Abstract

Many active learning methods use annotation cost or expert quality as part of
their framework to select the best data for annotation. While these methods
model expert quality, availability, or expertise, they have no direct
influence on any of these elements. We present a novel framework built upon
decision-theoretic active learning that allows the learner to directly
control label quality by allocating a time budget to each annotation. We
show that our method is able to improve performance efficiency of the active
learner through an interruption mechanism trading off the induced error with
the cost of annotation. Our simulation experiments on three document
classification tasks show that some interruption is almost always better than
none, but that the optimal interruption time varies by dataset.
