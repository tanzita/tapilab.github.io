#### Abstract

Traditional noun phrase coreference resolution systems represent features only
of pairs of noun phrases. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method
that enables features over *sets* of noun phrases, resulting in a
first-order probabilistic model for coreference. We outline a set of
approximations that make this approach practical, and apply our method to the
ACE coreference dataset, achieving a 45% error reduction over a comparable
method that only considers features of pairs of noun phrases. This result
demonstrates an example of how a first-order logic representation can be
incorporated into a probabilistic model and scaled efficiently.
