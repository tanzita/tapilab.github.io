#### Abstract

Recently, many advanced machine learning approaches have been proposed for
coreference resolution; however, all of the discriminatively-trained models
reason over mentions rather than entities. That is, they do not explicitly
contain variables indicating the 'canonical' values for each attribute of an
entity (e.g., name, venue, title, etc.). This canonicalization step is
typically implemented as a post-processing routine to coreference resolution
prior to adding the extracted entity to a database. In this paper, we propose
a discriminatively-trained model that jointly performs coreference resolution
and canonicalization, enabling features over hypothesized entities. We
validate our approach on two different coreference problems: newswire anaphora
resolution and research paper citation matching, demonstrating improvements in
both tasks and achieving an error reduction of up to 62% when compared to a
method that reasons about mentions only.
