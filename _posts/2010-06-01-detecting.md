#### Abstract

We analyze over 500 million Twitter messages from an eight month period and
find that tracking a small number of flu-related keywords allows us to
forecast future influenza rates with high accuracy, obtaining a 95%
correlation with national health statistics. We then analyze the robustness of
this approach to spurious keyword matches, and we propose a document
classification component to filter these misleading messages. We find that
this document classifier can reduce error rates by over half in simulated
false alarm experiments, though more research is needed to develop methods
that are robust in cases of extremely high noise.
