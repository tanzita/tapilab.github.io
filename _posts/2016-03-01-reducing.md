#### Abstract

As text classifiers become increasingly used in observational studies, it
    is critical to consider not only their accuracy but also their robustness
    to changes in the data distribution. In this paper, we consider the case
    where there is a confounding variable $Z$ that influences both the text
    features $W$ and the class variable $Y$. For example, a classifier trained
    to predict the health status of a user based on their online
    communications may be confounded by socioeconomic variables. When the
    influence of $Z$ changes from training to testing data, we find that
    classifier accuracy can degrade rapidly. Our approach, based on Pearl's
    back-door adjustment, estimates the underlying effect of a text variable
    on the class variable while controlling for the confounding variable. We
    conduct an observational study to estimate the effect of location on
    dispositional affect, with gender as a confounder. We find that our
    adjustment results in more accurate estimates of effect sizes over a range
    of possible confounding strengths.
