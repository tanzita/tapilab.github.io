#### Abstract

We extend previous work on tree kernels to estimate the similarity between the
dependency trees of sentences. Using this kernel within a Support Vector
Machine, we detect and classify relations between entities in the Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) corpus of news articles. We examine the utility of
different features such as Wordnet hypernyms, parts of speech, and entity
types, and find that the dependency tree kernel achieves a 20% F1 improvement
over a "bag-of-words" kernel.
