#### Abstract

Over the past two decades, statistical machine learning approaches to natural
language processing have largely replaced earlier logic-based systems. These
probabilistic methods have proven to be well-suited to the ambiguity inherent
in human communication. However, the shift to statistical modeling has mostly
abandoned the representational advantages of logic-based approaches. For
example, many language processing problems can be more meaningfully expressed
in first-order logic rather than propositional logic. Unfortunately, most
machine learning algorithms have been developed for propositional knowledge
representations. <br> In recent years, there have been a number of attempts to
combine logical and probabilistic approaches to artificial
intelligence. However, their impact on real-world applications has been
limited because of serious scalability issues that arise when algorithms
designed for propositional representations are applied to first-order logic
representations. In this thesis, we explore approximate learning and inference
algorithms that are tailored for higher-order representations, and demonstrate
that this synthesis of probability and logic can significantly improve the
accuracy of several language processing systems.
