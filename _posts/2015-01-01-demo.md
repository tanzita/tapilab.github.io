#### Abstract

Understanding the demographics of users of online social networks has
important applications for health, marketing, and public messaging. In this
paper, we predict the demographics of Twitter users based on whom they
follow. Whereas most prior approaches rely on a supervised learning approach,
in which individual users are labeled with demographics, we instead create a
distantly labeled dataset by collecting audience measurement data for 1,500
websites (e.g., 50% of visitors to gizmodo.com are estimated to have a
bachelor's degree). We then fit a regression model to predict these
demographics using information about the followers of each website on
Twitter. The resulting average held-out correlation is .77 across six
different variables (gender, age, ethnicity, education, income, and child
status). We additionally validate the model on a smaller set of Twitter users
labeled individually for ethnicity and gender, finding performance that is
surprisingly competitive with a fully supervised approach.

**Outstanding Paper, Honorable Mention**
