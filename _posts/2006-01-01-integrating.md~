#### Abstract

In order for relation extraction systems to obtain human-level performance,
they must be able to incorporate relational patterns inherent in the data (for
example, that one's sister is likely one's mother's daughter, or that children
are likely to attend the same college as their parents). Hand-coding such
knowledge can be time-consuming and inadequate. Additionally, there may exist
many interesting, unknown relational patterns that both improve extraction
performance and provide insight into text. We describe a probabilistic
extraction model that provides mutual benefits to both "top-down" relational
pattern discovery and "bottom-up" relation extraction.
