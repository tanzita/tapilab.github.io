#### Abstract

Personality plays a fundamental role in human interaction. With the increasing
posting of text on the internet, automatic detection of a person's personality
based on the text she produces is an important step to labeling and analyzing
human behavior at a large scale. To date, most approaches to personality
classification have modeled feature representations of the text to produce
output classifications. In this paper we use structured classification
approaches that learn and model both feature representations of text and
dependencies between output labels (i.e. personality traits). Our study finds
that there seems to be a correlation between Agreeableness and Emotional
Stability and that it may be helping boost accuracy for Agreeableness when
compared to more traditional approaches for supervised classification.
